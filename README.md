Setup: 
Install [Fit-SNE] (https://github.com/KlugerLab/FIt-SNE) and update [TSNE_PATH] in [src/constants.py] to use the relative path to this package. The numerics experiments require [networkx]. 

Examples:
See [notebooks/example.ipynb] for examples of how to generate force colorings. See [notebooks/numerics_trial.ipynb] for how to run a trial of the numerics experiments in section 5 of the paper.
